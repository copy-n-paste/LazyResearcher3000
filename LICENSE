You are free to use, copy, remix, print, forget, rewrite, or even pretend you wrote this project. Seriously. We don’t care.

Just don’t:
- Blame us if it writes nonsense
- Sue us if your professor calls it “too good to be written by you”
- Expect it to replace actual research (lol)

By using this software, you agree to pretend it was hard to make and tell people you “coded all night.”

This license has no restrictions. Just vibes. Go build cool stuff.
